# Penguins-Explore

The project is based on a collection of penguin data. It aims to present a different approach to data visualization. The repository contains the penguins_size.csv file, which is the analyzed data set, penguin_explore - the raw code file written in R, and two files named PenguinsVisualization. One of them is a ready-made html report and the other is R Markdown code. Additionally, the repository includes a short presentation on data visualization.
